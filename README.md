# Kai's quick ReadMe Generator

    This program is a Node.js command line application that uses the inquirer package to prompt the user with a series of questions about their project, and then generates a professional-looking README file based on their responses. The README file includes sections for a project description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instructions, and contact information. The program uses the fs package to write the generated content to a file called README.md in the current working directory.
